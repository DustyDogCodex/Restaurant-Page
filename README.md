# Restaurant-Page

In this project, I created a website for a fictional Indian restaurant. The project guidelines stipulated that the website needed to have tabbed browsing, with all HTML contents (apart from 2 empty divs) needing to be generated dynamically using JavaScript. 

Through this project I learned:

1) How to use webpack to keep track of your project's dependencies.
2) The benefits of using JavaScript classes.
3) How to import/export functions and classes using ES6 modules.
4) The benefits of writing modular code which increases reusablitity of written code.
5) Increased proficiency for generating HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.

Overall I really enjoyed this project. This project helped me get better at using JS to create and manipulate DOM elements, getting used to working with webpack and getting comfortable with using JS classes.
